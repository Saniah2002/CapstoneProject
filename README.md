Honors College Capstone Project on "Effectivity Analysis of Hybrid Recommender System"


E-commerce, often known as e-business or electronic business, is essentially the sale and purchase of services and goods using an electronic medium, such as the Internet. (Team, 2024). It is part of the larger industry known as electronic business (e-business), which encompasses all the activities necessary to run a firm online. (Bloomenthal, 2023). Utilizing online commerce is a widely adopted global sales strategy that enables both product sellers and service providers to effortlessly enhance sales and increase revenue. Statistics say, global ecommerce sales are expected to reach $8 trillion by 2026, accounting for 22% of the total retail sector. Ecommerce business has accelerated as more individuals avoid visiting physical stores due to the pandemic. (DeMatas, 2020).

Before ecommerce, shoppers would visit stores, communicate their needs to the store clerk, and receive personalized recommendations. The process often included cross-selling or upselling, where the clerk might suggest complementary accessories or a higher-end version of the chosen item at the checkout counter. Online retailers may lack the same in-person experience, but a well-designed ecommerce recommendation system provides personalized suggestions based on past purchases and browsing behavior. (BigCommerce, 2024). It is an information filtering system that aims to anticipate a user's 'rating' or 'preference' for a certain item or product. Recommendation services rely on specific datasets, and different types of systems emerge based on the nature of these datasets. Commonly, there are distinctions between content-based, collaborative-based, popularity based and hybrid recommendation systems. (team, 2020)
Content-based recommendation systems provide items or material analyzing past preferences of a user. When it comes to collaborative approaches, the recommendations are based on people who have similar rating habits. If they previously expressed a strong interest in a particular object, the system would continue to suggest it. (Upwork Team, 2024) While popularity-based model provides recommendation depending on the popularity. (Sreekala, 2020) A hybrid recommendation strategy combines multiple approaches targeting accuracy and diversity in recommendation. (Upwork Team, 2024)

The focus of this study is to understand the working mechanism and build a hybrid recommendation system combining content-based filtering, collaborative filtering and popularity-based model that can accurately recommend products. The objective of the study would be to conduct individual logistic regression analysis on content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, and popularity-based model, to determine the recall, precision, and accuracy of each of the algorithm and compare those with the accuracy and precision of the hybrid system. The significance of the research arises from its ability to enhance the field of recommendation systems, improve the e-commerce user experience, and provide practical insights for enterprises seeking to optimize their online platforms.
