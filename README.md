# CapstoneProject
Honors College Capstone Project on "Effectivity Analysis of Hybrid Recommender System"

The focus of this study is to understand the working mechanism and build a hybrid recommendation system combining content-based filtering, collaborative filtering and popularity-based model that can accurately recommend products. The objective of the study would be to conduct individual logistic regression analysis on content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, and popularity-based model, to determine the recall, precision, and accuracy of each of the algorithm and compare those with the accuracy and precision of the hybrid system. The significance of the research arises from its ability to enhance the field of recommendation systems, improve the e-commerce user experience, and provide practical insights for enterprises seeking to optimize their online platforms.
